# recommendme

On this project I used Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, EJS to host HTML, Express, Mongoose for the database, Method-Override to update/delete and Dot Env. I hosted my project using Mongo Atlas and Railway. 

My approach was to create a clean and user-friendly website to view music and movies. I started with the wireframes which evolved once I reached the individual show pages but otherwise stayed mostly the same. The routes I envisioned before starting stayed the same. I started with the file structure and then made my Schemas to form the data. I then created the routes and basic show pages before styling and fleshing those out. 

I researched websites I am a fan of for inspiration and found most used React so I was not able to get my homepage to look how I wanted which is an unsolved problem that I will revisit. 

User Stories:

As a user, I want to get music/movie recommendations by seeing what is on the page.

As a user I want to be able to recommend an album/movie based on what is on the page.
